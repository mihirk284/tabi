I am a Researcher at the [Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU)](https://www.ntnu.no). I completed my Ph.D. in Engineering Cybernetics in 2025 at [NTNU](https://www.ntnu.no) under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Kostas Alexis](https://www.ntnu.edu/employees/konstantinos.alexis) and co-supervision of [Prof. Dr. Davide Scaramuzza](https://rpg.ifi.uzh.ch/people_scaramuzza.html). My Ph.D. thesis, titled ["Vision-based Navigation for Aerial Robots: From Parallelized Simulation to Resilient Flight in Cluttered Environments"](https://nva.sikt.no/registration/019976cfee7c-1571705e-69c5-4f39-a32a-45f7c7913505), focuses on enabling resilient control, navigation, and planning through learned representations. I have developed the [Aerial Gym Simulator](https://github.com/ntnu-arl/aerial_gym_simulator), a massively parallelized simulation and rendering framework to enable efficient policy learning and achieve robust sim-to-real transfer for diverse multirotor platforms.

I graduated from the [University of Nevada, Reno](https://www.unr.edu/) with a Master's degree in Computer Science and Engineering in 2021. I received my Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from [BITS Pilani](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/) in 2020.

During the final year of my Bachelor's and throughout my Master's, I was part of [Team CERBERUS](https://www.subt-cerberus.org/), the winning team of the [DARPA Subterranean Challenge](https://www.darpa.mil/research/challenges/subterranean). During this time, I worked on control and planning for multi-linked systems ([Bachelor's thesis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405896320330548)), cooperation of heterogeneous robot teams ([Master's thesis](https://www.proquest.com/openview/056c92619080f5962b2fd2eb43e25a57)), artifact detection, and hardware and software integration across diverse aerial and ground robot platforms.
