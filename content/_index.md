I am a PhD candidate at the Norweigan University of Science and Technology at the [**Autonomous Robots Lab**](www.autonomousrobotslab.com) advised by [**Prof. Kostas Alexis**](http://www.kostasalexis.com/). I am currently working on developing reinforcement learning-based control and planning approaches for safe, agile and robust navigation for aerial robots in confined, contested and cluttered environments. Before this, I did my Masters in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Nevada, Reno, where I was heavily involved in the activities of [**Team CERBBERUS**](www.subt-cerberus.com) participating in the [**DARPA Subterranean Challenge**](https://www.darpa.mil/program/darpa-subterranean-challenge).

I expect to graduate before May 2025. I am currently looking for internships in the field of planning and control for robotics and autonomous systems for the summer of 2024. If you are interested in my work, please feel free to reach out to me at [mihirk284@gmail.com](mailto:mihirk284@gmail.com).
